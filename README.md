# QuickTix Ticketing Application Overview

This ticketing system aims to assist mid-sized companies to allow users to submit tickets, technicians record and complete tickets, controllers to assign tickets to technicians, and administrators to perform C.R.U.D on users, user roles, departments, areas, statuses, and ticket templates. There is a simple reporting system to show administrators statistics on tickets.

The application ships with no predefined areas, departments, statuses, or ticket templates. This simple application is designed to be modular to allow different organizations to use their own jargon.
