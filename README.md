# QuickTix Ticketing Application

This ticketing system aims to assist mid-sized companies to allow users to submit tickets, technicians record and complete tickets, controllers to assign tickets to technicians, and administrators to perform C.R.U.D on users, user roles, trades, areas, statuses, and ticket templates. There is a simple reporting system to show administrators statistics on tickets.
